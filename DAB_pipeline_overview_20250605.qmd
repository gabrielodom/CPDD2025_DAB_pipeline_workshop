# What's the Point?

# What's the Point?

- An [endpoint](https://toolkit.ncats.nih.gov/glossary/endpoint/) is a "targeted outcome of a clinical trial that is statistically analyzed to help determine the efficacy and safety of the therapy being studied"
- **Endpoint Science** is the study of those endpoints, especially from an empirical/rigorous perspective
- The **DAB Pipeline** enables us to study how endpoints (*and the AI/ML models predicting them*) "react" to changes in the underlying data

### But why?
As [Brandt, Odom, et al. (2024)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38616571/) showed:

- Not all endpoints are created equal
- Endpoints don't always measure what they claim

## Garbage In---Garbage Out

- Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) models offer the potential for profound translational insights in SUD treatment, *if they are used correctly*
- AI/ML models are limited to the data you give them: these models will do their best to predict the endpoint you choose based on the demographic and clinical predictors you supply
- Unless you choose your endpoint carefully, AI/ML will give you the **right answer** to the **wrong question**
